# Analyze A/B test results


This project will perform an A/B test and interpret its results for an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Softwares and Tools

For this project, I have used python and its libraries namely:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Statsmodel.api

## Statistical Models 


For this project I have performed A/B Test along with building a regression model. The p-value for rejecting the NULL for set to be <= 0.5
